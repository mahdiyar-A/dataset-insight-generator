            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backend:</strong> C# ASP.NET Core for authentication, file
              handling, and PDF delivery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AI Engine:</strong> Python for dataset analysis,
              visualizations, and insight extraction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Database (minimal):</strong> Small SQL backend for user
